                Describes the rotation of the device in degrees where 0 is up on

                at the AP on the ceiling, the direction points toward the top of
                the vendor logo.  For directional antennas/APs, the peak

                orientation.  For directional APs, 0 describes the antenna as
                pointed horizontal, with positive values tilting up, and
                negative values pointing down.  AKA pitch.

                0 describes the devices default orientation.  This will normally
                be zero in most scenarios.  Would be used to rotate and antenna
                from vertical to horizontal polarization.  AKA roll.
