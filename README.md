# OpenIntent
[**OpenIntent**](https://github.com/google/openintent) is a collaborative
effort by network operators, manufacturers and  tooling companies to develop an
interoperability standard schema to describe the necessary information needed to
deploy network equipment.  The initial focus and effort on OpenIntent is
primarily around Wi-Fi, however the project is structured in such a way that
other technologies can leverage the same concept with their own models, given
interest and effort.

## Participation
There are a couple ways in which you can participate in the OpenIntent
community.

### Participate in the community discussions and meetings.
There is a [**Mailing List**](https://groups.google.com/g/openintent-wifi) where
discussions and information about meetings will be posted. Bring your
requirements, feedback and suggestions to this list and these meetings.
This will help drive the schema for intent resources.

We will begin scheduling bi-weekly (every other) meetings starting the week of
February 20th, 2023.

Information regarding the meeting should be sent out via the mailing list.

### Talk to your manufacturers and tooling providers
Request support for OpenIntent from your manufacturers and tooling companies.
Getting native support in design tools, vendor NMS and automation systems
reduces the amount of work everyone has to do.

If your vendor has a feature request portal, consider voting for support:

[**Aruba**](https://innovationzone.arubanetworking.hpe.com/ideas/CNX-I-155)

## Contributing
This repository is primarily for publishing the models, documents and other
material developed by the OpenIntent group.  As tooling is developed, it will
appear in other repositories.
