# OpenIntent
[**OpenIntent**](https://github.com/google/openintent) is a collaborative
effort by network operators, vendors, and tooling companies to develop an
interoperability standard schema to describe the necessary information needed to
deploy network equipment.  The initial focus and effort on OpenIntent is
primarily around Wi-Fi, however the project is structured in such a way that
other technologies can leverage the same concept with their own models, given
interest and effort.

## Contributing
This repository is primarily for publishing the models, documents and other
material developed by the OpenIntent group.  As tooling is developed, it will
appear in other repositories.
